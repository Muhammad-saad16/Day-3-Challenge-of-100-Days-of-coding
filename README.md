# Day-3-Challenge-of-100-Days-of-coding
Today's challenge was more difficult than I anticipated. I struggled with some of the coding concepts and had to spend extra time debugging. However, I persevered and was able to make progress. I'm proud of myself for not giving up and am looking forward to tomorrow's challenge.
